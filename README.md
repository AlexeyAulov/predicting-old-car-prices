Predicinting Old Car Prices

This project includes 1.5 million records of data where we train a Neural Network Model to predict
future car prices relative to the year. We also cleaned and configured dataset to match the US 
Market standards instead of Indian Market.  Used Libraries like SKlearn, TensorFlow and Keras to 
create Neural Network models. We will be Forecasting predictions using Keras Library to get the 
most accurate reading.
